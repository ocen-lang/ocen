/// fail: Function does not always return

// The point of this test is to check if we can successfully
// "look past" the missing function body and still typecheck /
// do analysis on the rest of the program.
//
// This should give 2 different errors, and does not check for
// the "missing identifier" error, as that is already covered
// in another test.
